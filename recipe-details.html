Addictive, worth a try, without oven, without eggs! delicious Vanilla & Chocolate Pudding. The jellies themselves are made with only dark chocolate, sugar, water and gelatine, so they’re easy to put together. Don’t be fooled by how fancy these treats look. It's as simple as bringing the sugar and water to the boil, then stirring through the chocolate and gelatine until melted (kind of similar to our 1-ingredient chocolate mousse recipe, with the addition of gelatine).</p></td>
